# InviteLink

InviteLink is a smart event access and guest management system built for precise, modern event control — starting with Nikahs and weddings.  
It replaces guesswork and gate chaos with QR/NFC invites, automated guest tracking, and real-time SMS notifications.

---

## 🎯 Overview

Each guest receives an invite card that includes:
- A **QR code** (and optionally an **NFC tag**) linked to their unique InviteLink.
- Their invite encodes who they are and how many guests (+1s) they can bring.

Guests scan or tap the invite to open the RSVP page where they:
- Confirm attendance
- Register their plus-ones (limited to their allowance)
- Choose parking options

At the event:
- **Security scans** QR or NFC codes for entry.
- **Wristbands** allow re-entry validation.
- **Admin dashboard** displays attendance, missing guests, and live status.
- **Automated SMS alerts** remind guests 10 mins before start time, notify late arrivals, and even offer parking promos.

## 🧱 Build Plan

1. **Stage 1 — Setup**
   - React Native
   - Add QR code generator utility.

2. **Stage 2 — RSVP Flow**
   - `/rsvp` page with guest form.
   - Store RSVP data.
   - Auto-generate guest QR/NFC link.

3. **Stage 3 — Dashboard**
   - `/admin` page showing live RSVP & attendance.
   - Twilio SMS integration.

4. **Stage 4 — Check-In Flow**
   - QR scan endpoint marks guests as checked in.
   - NFC tap works the same way.

5. **Stage 5 — Automations**
   - Schedule Twilio texts for reminders and “event started” notifications.

6. **Stage 6 — Physical Invites (Optional)**
   - Print and mail QR/NFC cards with personalized details.

# InviteLink Infrastructure

This repository contains the infrastructure setup for deploying the InviteLink application to Azure using Kubernetes (AKS) and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

## Infrastructure Overview

- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: Hosts the application and backend services.
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**: Stores Docker images for the application and backend.
- **Terraform**: Used for defining and provisioning the infrastructure.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates the CI/CD pipeline for building, pushing, and deploying the application.

## Folder Structure

- `infra/`: Contains Terraform configuration files for Azure infrastructure.
- `.github/workflows/`: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD.

## Prerequisites

1. Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads).
2. Install [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
3. Authenticate Azure CLI:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```
4. Set the Azure subscription:
   ```bash
   az account set --subscription "<your-subscription-id>"
   ```

## Steps to Deploy

1. Navigate to the `infra/` directory and initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
2. Plan the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```
3. Apply the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
4. Push changes to the repository to trigger the GitHub Actions pipeline.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions pipeline performs the following steps:
1. Builds Docker images for the frontend and backend.
2. Pushes the images to Azure Container Registry (ACR).
3. Deploys the application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
